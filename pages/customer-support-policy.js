          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Froshital acknowledges that customer satisfaction is the key
            cornerstone for its growth and customer-centricity is one of the
            core values that we, at Froshital, cherish and hope to uphold. We
            strive to provide the best customer experience from our end,
            however, if you face any issues and concerns with our services, we
            request you to refer to this policy which provides the detailed
            steps for customer grievance redressal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Company&#39;s Customer Support Policy has been formulated in
            line with regulatory guidelines and other applicable laws on
            Customer Service. The policy outlines the framework for addressing
            customer grievances.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Company defines customer complaints as a deficiency or a gap in
            the committed level of services rendered to the customer. Complaints
            can be on account of a breach in committed turnaround time,
            non-fulfillment of the request placed by customers, payment-related
            concerns, etc. It is clarified that the Company is purely an online
            intermediary connecting the sellers listed on Froshital platform
            with consumers and we neither control nor have any ownership of the
            products sold through our platform. Thus, all concerns with the
            fitness, merchantability, and adequacy of the products are the
            responsibility of the seller/retail partners and we will employ our
            best efforts to assist in getting all such product-related concerns
            resolved through them. We also request you to read the FAQs
            available at https://froshital.com/help as they may help to resolve
            certain queries that you may have concerning orders, returns,
            payments, Wallets, etc.
          </p>
